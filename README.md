### Installation

If you want to build your own version, make sure you have gnuclad
installed.

To install gnuclad, you can download the source at https://launchpad.net/gnuclad

For Arch users, use the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnuclad/

After you have installed gnuclad, to build just the svg, run:

    gnuclad ldt.csv SVG ldt.conf

You can run the script `build.sh` to build the svg, png, and the tarball
containing the source, ImageMagick is required to convert from svg to png.
